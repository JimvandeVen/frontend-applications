# Jeugdhulp Risico Indicator

## Introduction
Jeugdhulp Risico Indicator(JRI) was build for Gemeente Amsterdam to help the social workers get an indication of chance children in the youth services have of being placed into foster care. JRI wil help the social workers to see dangerous factors earlier and more often. JRI works with years of data, collected from youth services in the city of Amsterdam, to create the most accurate calculations.

## Working with youth services
During the production of JRI we continuasly spoke with the social workers working in Amsterdam. They provided us with valuable insights regarding their work and wishes. Some of these insights are listed below.
